Certain Cookies may be used on the Sites regardless of whether you are logged in to your account or not.<br>(b) Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that remain in the Cookie file of your browser until you leave the Site.<br>(c) Persistent Cookies remain in the Cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific Cookie). <br>(d) When we use session Cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Website, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as Cookies do not in themselves include any personal data). <br>(e) We may also employ Cookies so that we remember your computer or device when it is used to return to the Site to help customize your EstateSync experience. We may associate personal information with a Cookie file in those instances.<br>(f) We use Cookies to help us know that you are logged on, provide you with features based on your preferences, understand when you are interacting with our Services, and compile other information regarding the use of our Services.<br>(g) Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use Cookies to collect and store information. <br>(h) Our Website may use remarketing services, to serve ads on our behalf across the internet on third-party websites to previous visitors to our Sites. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use Cookies to serve ads based on your past visits to our Website or use of our app. Any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy, as well as Google&#x27;s privacy policies.

This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website/application functionality, and to document your consent to receiving products, services, or communications from us or our partners. If we link such information with personally identifiable information in a manner that identifies a particular individual, then we will treat all such information as PII for purposes of this Privacy Policy.<br>(m) When you use our Services, we may employ Web Beacons (also known as clear GIFs or tracking pixels) to anonymously track online usage patterns.

Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends, colleagues, or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the social sharing service. Please refer to the privacy policies of those social sharing services for more information about how they handle the data you provide to or share through them.<br>(b) Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting publicly to a social sharing network becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set with the social sharing service.

        <li><strong>‍</strong><strong>Analytic Services Provided By Others<br></strong>We may allow others to provide audience measurement and analytics services for us, to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet, and to track and report on the performance of those advertisements.

        <li><strong>Links to Third-Party Websites</strong><strong><br></strong>(a) Our Services, as well as the email messages sent with respect to our Services, may contain links or access to websites operated by third parties, including service providers, resources, and advertisers, that are beyond our control. Links or access to third parties from our Services are not an endorsement by us of such third parties, or their websites, applications, products, services, or practices.

These third parties may send their own Cookies to you and independently collect data.<br>(b) If you visit or access a third-party website, application, or other property that is linked to or accessed from our Services, we encourage you to read any privacy policies and terms and conditions of that third party before providing any personally identifiable information.

        <li><strong>Promotional Information Opt-Out<br></strong>You may opt-out of receiving promotional messages from us at any time by following the instructions in those messages sent to you, including emails, or by contacting us at any time using the Contact Us information at the end of this Privacy Policy. In doing so, you elect not to receive correspondence from us or have Your Information shared with other entities for their marketing purposes. If you opt-out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, about Services you have requested, or our ongoing business relations.<strong></strong><br></li>
        <li><strong>International Privacy Practices<br></strong>In order to provide our products and services to you, we may send and store your personal information outside of the country where you reside or are located, including in the United States. Accordingly, if you reside or are located outside of the United States, your personal information may be transferred outside of the country where you reside or are located, including countries that may not, or do not, provide the same level of protection for your personal information. We are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information when it is transferred. If you reside or are located within the European Union (&quot;EU&quot;) or European Economic Area (&quot;EEA&quot;) and such transfers occur, we take appropriate steps to provide the same level of protection for the processing carried out in any such countries as you would have within the EU and EEA to the extent feasible under applicable law. By accessing and using the EstateSync Website or our Services, users who reside, or are located, in countries outside of the United States, agree and consent to the transfer to, and processing of, personal information on servers located outside of the country where they reside and assume the risk that the protection of such information may be different, and may be less protective, than those required under the laws of their residence or location.<br></li>
        <li><strong>Do Not Track Settings<br></strong>Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a &quot;do not track&quot; feature that sends signals to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different than blocking or deleting Cookies, as browsers with a &quot;do not track&quot; feature enabled may still accept Cookies. There currently is no accepted standard for how to respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal.<br></li>
        <li><strong>Your California Privacy Rights<br></strong>(a) California Civil Code Section 1798.83 entitles California residents to request information concerning whether a business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
